# Getting started with Cisco Modelling Labs (Personal and Enterprise)

Cisco Modeling Labs is a tool for building virtual network simulations (or labs) for you to test out new topologies, protocols, and config changes; automate network tests via CI/CD pipeline integration; and learn new things about the cool world of networking. This guide will walk

# Sandbox environment

To follow this lab you will need an instance of CML2. For this you have 2 options

Enterprise - . If you are interested in CML Enterprise please contact your Cisco account team or a Cisco partner

Personal - Which is $199. If you are interested in purchasing CML Personal you can do so from this [link](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/cisco-modeling-labs-personal/cisco-cml-personal) 

Alternatively, if you'd just like to try CML out you do have the excellent DevNet sandbox where you can reserve an instance of CML2 for up to 4 hours. This sandbox provides access to a Cisco Modeling Labs system that can be used to explore the capabilities of the newest release of Cisco Modeling Labs. This is quite a generous with almost 40GB of RAM and 57GB of disk space so theres space to do some pretty decent simulations. All DevNet sandboxes are completely free and can be accessed within seconds.

# The Basics

If you're using the sandbox when you first login there's already a premade simulation you can try out. I'm going to stop and delete this for now and walk you through the process of creating you're own simulation but feel free to explore the simulation to get to grips 

# The API

One of the real advantages of this version of CML is the excellent API which allows us to atuo

Tasks we could automate include:

Spin up and down simulations
Edit simulations
Get information from devices on a simulation

# Python SDK
